Notes:

- On first glance, it would appear that every entry of ad topic line is unique. This isn't useful to us, as there are no distinct categories available to perform classification analysis. Thus, it may be wise to employ NLP algorithms to (A) assign distinct category labels or (B) cluster each entry into groups.
  - Most of cities also seem to be unique, thus also likely providing not useful data. Consider grouping cities by different regions to acquire meaningful data. Try using GeoNames to perform city name mapping.
